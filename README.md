# EZShell
Scripts and tools for automating all that busywork in your environment.

## EZShell?
Most of the content here is Powershell or shell scripting, with a hint of YAML, and all of it is intended to make my (and possibly your) life easier by automating common or problematic tasks in an environment.

## Is this a project or something?
Nah, it's just a way to dump knowledge about common tasks out of my brain so I can make room for new stuff (currently Kubernetes).
